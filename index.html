            <h1>WHAT IS CORONA VIRUS</h1>
            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
                
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
                
                The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

            <h1>WHAT IS COVID-19</h1>
            <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

                Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.
                
                Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
                
                Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>

            <h1>Prevention</h1>
            <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
                Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
                Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
                Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                Stay home if you feel unwell.
                If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
                Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.

                <h1>SOCIAL DISTANCE</h1>
                <p>Most of us call it "social distancing," but it can help to think of it as "physical distancing" instead. Social distancing puts space between people. By keeping their distance from others, people infected with the virus are less likely to spread it.

                    The virus mainly spreads when someone breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes, which sends tiny droplets into the air. People standing nearby can get these droplets in their eyes, nose, or mouth, or they can breathe them in.
                    
                    When there's at least 6 feet between people, these droplets are more likely to fall onto the ground rather than on other people. Less often, tinier droplets can linger in the air for minutes to hours. These are called aerosols.
                    
                    Because infected people may not have symptoms, it is best to keep a safe distance whenever you're around people you don't live with.</p>

                <h1>MASK</h1>
                <p>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
